         2) Implement mandatory API functions below; you must re-implement
            those that raise exceptions (i.e. vote, select, sabotage).

         3) If you need any of the optional callback API functions, implement
            them (i.e. all functions named on*() are callbacks).

       Aside from parameters passed as arguments to the functions below, you 
       can also access the game state via the self.game variable, which contains
       a State class defined in game.py.

       For debugging, it's recommended you use the self.log variable, which
       contains a python logging object on which you can call .info() .debug()
       or warn() for instance.  The output is stored in a file in the #/logs/
       folder, named according to your bot.
